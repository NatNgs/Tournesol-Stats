    "# Comparisons tool 2: Reducing distances from video to video\n",

    "This tool aims to give to a tournesol user a list of suggested comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comparisons between 2 videos marked as \"Public\" (will not suggest comparisons with \"Private\" videos)\n",
    "- Compute the distance between compared videos, by the minimum number of comparisons to cross to get from one to the other\n",
    "- Find good new comparisons to reduce these distances as much as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "- Knowing how to get Authentication JWT from Tournesol website\n",
    "- Having more than 20 compared videos (With few videos, this tool is not useful and may not suggest any comparisons)\n",
    "\n",
    "Special rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Will not suggest to add comparisons to videos where there are less contributors than your comparisons with it\\\n",
    "  (Prefer improving popular videos to improve global Tournesol connectivity as much as possible)"
